I know UI is not rich look and have some errors still need to be considered. I am sorry for this.

--SKUDESC9 has wrong location entry changed from Perimeter to Center
--SKUDESC4 sub category changed from All Other to Cheese All Other
--could not found matches for these items SKUDESC6,SKUDESC13,SKUDESC17 to track in metadata info , so i considered as it is.
